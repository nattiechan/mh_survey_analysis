,Briefly describe what you think the industry as a whole and/or employers could do to improve mental health support for employees.,Would you feel comfortable discussing a mental health issue with your coworkers?
0,therapy should be covered by health insurance benefits,0
1,Companies should be more explicit about the mental health resources that are offered.,0
2,Discuss mental health more openly.,0
3,Actually admitting that mental health affects life of employees badly. And not to think of them as a resource.,0
4,I can not speak for an entire industry.,0
5,I think sometimes the tech industry creates isolation by default I am not sure how you can get tech guys to crawl out of their hole,0
6,"Society as a whole doesn't understand or support mental illness. I just saw my primary care doctor at Kaiser, and he told me to ""get back to work soon"" while I am fighting for a reason to keep on going with this severe depressive episode (I have bipolar 2)",0
7,"Awareness, changed work schedules and expectations",0
8,idk,0
9,"Discuss it more openly. Drive discussion on education and away from stigma. More actively discuss treatment. Improve benefits in this space. Ensure insurance improves its policies and pay,ents to providers. ",0
10,I think it is across all industry,0
11,Hold trainings to normalize mental health issues.  To help reduce the stigma and reinforce how prevalent they actually are and how with treatment people with mental health issues are the same as everyone else.  ,0
12,"Boundary setting from the executive level up as far as working hours. Offering job ""perks"" that aren't just the MINIMAL legal requirements but aspects that actually improve and instigate better self care (whether that be resources to access or actual stipends to be able to access those resources in practice). Setting reasonable expectations as far as communication and culture. Diversifying your employee base.",0
13,Talk about it openly and often. Offer services.,0
14,Create awareness about mental health,0
15,Perhaps there should be some sort of training or education around mental health and diversity and acceptance.,0
16,Anything. I don't think it's addressed at all.,0
17,Continue to reduce stigma. Particularly bad amongst older developers where there’s a cultural difference. ,0
18,Make it OK to talk about.,0
19,OSMI helps opens eyes of those who do not suffer mental illness,0
20,no,0
21,Better education around what mental health looks like and how to know when you may need to seek additional help. Also better training around how to respond to someone's mental health condition.,0
22,"To much hate directed towards people with mental illness, especially in the Northeastern Ohio tech community(Akron/Cleveland)",0
23,Easy access to support. Whether that's just some written material or the contact info for professional help that can respond quickly. ,0
24,"Cut out the [achievement, bro, toxic masculine] culture. Acknowledge mental health as a normal thing that just happens.",0
25,More time off with less explanations.  EAPs.  Flexible schedules and work location.,0
26,"Treat it like a physical health issue, and not blame the victim. Help the employee get effective help from professionals. Find different roles that might be more appropriate without blame.",0
27,Having more people high in the management chain talk openly about their mental health issues without retaliation ,0
28,"create awareness programs, provide help and support",0
29,explicitly define sick/leave time policies as applying to diagnosed physical AND mental illness. ,0
30,Need programs like OSMI.,0
31,"Awareness. Unfortunately, the state of the art in mental health medicine itself is many, many decades behind physical.health. So it is hard to judge employers having a progressive approach when the medical institution is so backwards.",0
32,Current tech interview practices (whiteboarding / live coding) are demoralizing and contribute to ones feelings of not being welcome in the industry.,0
33,"Despite OSMI and Greggy B and everyone else pushing for it, it feels like mental health is still discussed in hushed tones in corners of our industry.  I don't feel comfortable talking about it in person, though I tweet about it often.  This needs t change.",0
34,"Emphasise work-life balance, de-emphasise the ""hero"" stories of working late.",0
35,"One thing that bothers me is that a lot of companies seem to think that being a ""lifestyle"" company means putting up a bar at work. ",0
36,dont know,0
37,"Benefits are often provided and support lines provided but it usually is the extent of what they will do. Often in discussing openly, people approach you differently and often not in a good way.",0
38,"Training, and guidelines, may help deal with the prejudices associated with mental health issues at work.",0
39,More focus on personal time and well being.,0
40,"They can create an amusement center for the employees. they should provide a proper time of leisure for the employment. The employee should give enough time to their family. And the most important thing is that, every employee have to be given safe environment of job security and freedom as much as it can be able.",0
41,"need to understand the impact of stress and anxiety, especially when facing illogical deadlines or constantly worried about layoff",0
42,"Accept that we're all actually humans and that's ok. Don't frame negative behavior (alcoholism, antisocial, work obsessed) as positive.",0
43,more proactive support & education,0
44,"just talk and listen, discuss together, provide health benefit",0
45,I,0
46,Stop treating employees as disposable brains.,0
47,"it's a comfort thing at this point imo, needs to be talked about so it doesn't feel weird to bring up issues",0
48,Talk about it more openly. Encourage a better work/life balance. Question more the culture too often in place (to stress about short term and never work on long term),0
49,Treating developers as humans as opposed to resources they don’t understand. ,0
50,"Be more open about it, remove the stigma",0
51,I don't know,0
52,Remove the stigma of it being a condition of hiring or continued employment.,0
53,Stop encouraging 'crunch' mentality & incentivising extreme overtime & neglect of vacation time.,0
54,"Consistently use top-level descriptions like ""wellness"" or ""health"", emphasising that ""mental"" is a subset of ""physical"". Recognise that health issues are actually very common. Work with people to accommodate health issues.",0
55,A better focus on putting all employees into a position to succeed.  Would depend from person to person.  ,0
56,Provide support (at all) and publicise it internally. ,0
57,Not sure,0
58,I think the parts of the industry that acknowledge burnout and the dangers of hero culture are doing the industry good on this front but it needs to be more widespread.,0
59,"Empathy, Empathy, Empathy. We are not coding robots. Know your people, create open and supportive working place.",0
60,"More resources, more acceptance, more conversation. I think that mental health is something people are afraid to address because of lack of knowledge and understanding about what it means to suffer from a mental illness. ",0
61,Employers of small- and medium-size companies don't pay ANY attention to employee's health. The only thing that matters is making the money.,0
62,"Ensure insurance provides coverage, be flexible with personal time",0
63,"more awareness,more clear avenues of support, less stigma",0
64,It seems that almost every dev I met had a burnout or depression. It would be nice if employers acknowledged it as a normal part of life and learn to just deal with it.,0
65,"The values of the tech industry are very much focused on day-to-day productivity, which can be very difficult for people with mental health issues. My experience has been that employers are unwilling to differentiate between the performance impacts of mental health issues and other causes of low productivity. This leads to punishment and shaming, even when the company espouses support for sufferers. I think companies could focus more on what people have to offer, helping find good fit positions, and understanding that those with mental health issues will often have a more cyclical pattern of productivity than others.",0
66,"Understand employees/job candidates who have mental health problems and learn to work with their abilities. I feel like employers today are entirely focused on production, and if the person has problems that could affect their quantity of production, employers have no problem getting rid of them or not hiring them.",0
67,Talk about it openly and make it known that you can seek treatment without fear of stigma or other negative repercussions. Discipline for those who speak badly of colleagues with mental illness. ,0
68,They could offer better benefits and estimate timelines better (or offer some flexibility) so that people are able to take time to take care of themselves,0
69,"Try to make sure that people are aware that mental disorders are NOT caused by someone being ""weak"" or ""undisciplined"", but that it's often times due to a physical issue (i.e. brain doesn't have as many receptors or has too many receptors for a certain type of chemical, etc).",0
70,Provide preventive doctor appointments like they do with chiropractic or accupunture as part of the medical plan,0
71,There is a lot of pressure to perform and accomplish a lot of work quickly.  More open acknowledgement of how common mental health issues are and how high pressure situation can create mental health issues would hopefully destigmatize them.,0
72,Be more educated that mental health issues are common and do not make a person less capable of being productive contributors to the company's success.  Be flexible and understanding when employees need accommodations to maintain good mental health.,0
73,"Stop stigmatising mental health and taking it as a joke or something that you ""can overcome with a bit of chocolate""",0
74,"I think no employers do very well in this area, as America as a whole is terrible at the acceptance of mental illness as a disease and treating people with it with compassion.",0
75,Treat mental illness as any other disease or medical condition.,0
76,"Employers should make their mental health benefits as clear as their physical health benefits (eg. copays, treatment covered, etc). I haven't experienced it personally but I think a PTO MINIMUM is a great idea, to encourage people to take time off.",0
77,"I am not sure what they can do differently. Mental health issues are not something I have personal experience with and cannot speak to the treatment and response of employers, and I would not want to speak out of turn when it comes to mental health issues of which I know very little about. ",0
78,Reduce unrealistic deadlines that cause stress.,0
79,"Encourage employees to have non-work time - so much of the industry is focused on ""working when you're not at work"" either on assignments or side projects in order to get anywhere, and it's incredibly counterproductive to mental health.",0
80,"Tools, resources, open communication",0
81,"We need a safe space to discuss it, we cannot be afraid of openly talk about. We are only allowed to talk about mental health to psychologists and psychiatrists, even discussing it with family is not as open as it should be.",0
82,We need to increase awareness of mental illnesses and work at getting rid of the stigma surrounding discussing them.,0
83,Talk about it more openly during new hire onboarding and annual benefits selection — some signs to be aware of and resources available.,0
84,"Give more information, treat people kindly and with respect, and be open to discussing about mental illness",0
85,"In the tech industry, clients and co-workers I told were super supportive, but I've heard of terrible experiences of others in the tech industry as well. It makes me think I may just be lucky or good at acquiring awesome clients.",0
86,"We're getting there, but still too much focus is placed solely on burn-out, and breakdowns still build up with alarming regularity. ",0
87,Talk about it at the same level and frequency as physical illnesses. ,0
88,"Talk about it, include it in healthcare packages, provide stress-relief tools and methods",0
89,Promote mental health more and allow employees to take mental health days. Allow much more PTO or a generous work from home policy. Let people step away from the stresses of work more frequently to improve their mental health.,0
90,Opened and support when people are suffering. To accept mental illness as a part of everyday life,0
91,Work to remove the stigma; let emloyees know it's cool to talk about it and remove the fear of having a mental illness impact your job.,0
92,Openly discuss the issues.,0
93,Have open discussions about mental health,0
94,"I think we do OK. That said, I think we're demographically predisposed to people with mental health issues. Who else is attracted to a field of very intelligent semi-solitary misfits working marathon hours?",0
95,"More open discussion, more time flexibility, less hectic work schedules",0
96,Magically make everyone more empathetic,0
97,More pressure on employers to offer support and guidelines for employees,0
98,"In general, full-time tech company employees have good benefits (especially at big companies) and good benefits usually include mental health care (at least in Washington and California where I've worked). But it's also my experience that people will speak at length about their exercise routines etc and will not be as open about self care or mental healthcare.",0
99,Medical insurance ,0
100,"High stress cultures and burnout can exacerbate mental health symptoms in those prone to them. Treating employees like people, not machines, helps. Flexibility and open mindedness help.

As tech has become more mainstream, tech jobs have become less friendly to people with quirks and eccentricities.",0
101,"Correct ""benevolent discrimination"" where someone ""just wants to help"" or ""didn't want to stress you out"" and effectively keeps potential work opportunities from you.",0
102,Be more openly supportive.,0
103,"Reducing stigma would be great, but that's awfully vague and difficult",0
104,"at a base level, not contribute to disorders in the form of official work policies or unwritten work culture. i.e. ""optional"" work functions for people with anxiety, hyper-stressful situations for people who have trouble coping in those situations, etc. that is, the job itself should not be detrimental. beyond that, having an open discussion about it, letting employees know it won't be held against them, having resources, making employees aware of resources. being understanding. accepting that even though i struggle, i do want to work hard and make a contribution",0
105,Just acceptation ,0
106,Accept that mental health is as normal and important as physical health.,0
107,Better payment and less extra hours... it´s just about anxiety and stress,0
108,Would be nice to see more companies actively pushing employees to take time for themselves.,0
109,"Speaking more openly without judgement is a great start I find. And educating people is of utmost importance. 
If one is educated on a subject, they know what to expect. The unknown makes people defensive and apprehensive I think. Not to mention stereotypes being perceived as facts. ",0
110,"Stop encouraging people to live at work, stop encouraging people to work more than 40 hours a week, demonstrate what it actually means to have a supportive working environment for those with mental health problems, stop making us all work in open work spaces",0
111,"I think there are lots of people in tech who could use assistance, but who don't get it.",0
112,Treat is the same as a physical issue,0
113,"I think there is a great deal of pressure to work 60+ hours which leads to stress, anxiety and other mental health issues. Eliminating the pressure to work on vacation and take time to recharge and focus on personal care is important. ",0
114,"The industry praises ""hustle"" culture, which pushes people to work over 40 hours a week & implies that those who do not work or learn over the standard 40 are lazy.",0
115,Insurance and flex-time for doctor appointments.,0
116,Not sure. This is a problem with broader societal forces in my opinion.,0
117,Too many tech industry leaders/managers are bullies. That and teh bro atmosphere at so many places are a block to effective mental health support.,0
118,"I'm seeing a trend in the right direction of open conversation about it, but only in small pockets of the industry. It needs to be normalized more widely. The biggest challenge is the stigma. Even places that offer mental health care as a benefit don't do a great job of communicating it because it seems to be a taboo subject.",0
119,Be a lot more explicit on their processes and procedures. Be pro-active voices in the industry for good mental health support and help remove stigma,0
120,"Open to ideas, funded to support, too many aspergers jokes",0
121,"Less stigma, more open discussion.",0
122,train managers,0
123,"Its about perception, they cannot manage their perceptions and fall for them whatever they think so first they have understand mental illness can be treated with support and care and treating the person with the same manner, so that it will not further increase",0
124,I don't know.,0
125,Acceptance that these issues are real,0
126,"Work towards removing the stigma and focus on mental/emotiona/physical health. Often the industry values you as a productive worker, not a complete, holistic, and healthy individual.",0
127,Eliminate bro culture. Become more accepting of all people,0
128,"Better insurance for various therapists, support groups, better understanding of the shades of mental illness.",0
129,Recognizing that people have problems and give them time to deal with them. The same time it would be for going to see a physical doctor or a dentist.,0
130,"A work place culture that respects personal life is most important: flexible schedules, work from home, asynchronous communication that can be silenced when off duty, …. Quiet working conditions also reduce stress. Teams that enjoy working together are good for all involved.",0
131,Be more open about the conversation; make it part of a culture of inclusivity,0
132,"Make it feel safe(r) to discuss it. I always felt and assumed that it's not a good idea to be known to have mental health issues. Please note that I did not see others mistreated and I did not experience problems so I cannot justify this assumption --- it was ""in the air"".",0
133,Remove the stigma of just talking about it,0
134,"I think raising awareness and showing employers that mental health issues are REAL, but also showing examples of successful employees who have mental health issues.",0
135,\-,0
136,"Diversify beyond Silicon Valley and its societal values, which inherently seem to allow for mental health to be misjudged.",0
137,"On an individual/peer level, I think there's some awareness that a lot of us have ""social"" issues that are sometimes related to mental health disorders/issues. It seems like that would give people in our industry at least a step up in handling the conversation. My experience seems to reflect that. On a more institutional level, I'm not sure of a best course that would fit all. In my personal experience, efforts toward supportive conversation and connection to relevant resources were lacking from management, so that's a good place to start. ",0
138,"Stop lionizing and promoting manic episodes as normal or desirable methods of producing work. The culture doesn't allow for enough self-care — when you have to work 12+ hour days, then respond outside office hours to emails/IMs, it's difficult to build in enough time to sleep enough, or take breaks for meals, or exercise, or meditate. The glorification of people who spend their entire lives working in a frenzied trance state is extremely difficult to live up to, and a potential trigger for mania. ",0
139,"Reduce stigma, stop glorifying overwork, treat mental health like physical health, focus on long-term employee outcomes, value employee well-being in and of itself.",0
140,Empathy,0
141,"reduce stigma, raise awareness and training ",0
142,Create more processes and make more clear what obligations an worker has with the company.,0
143,"Be more vocal about supporting employees with issues, and supporting mental health time off.",0
144,Good healthcare benefits and work accomodations with no bias against them (such as allowing people to work remote more often if needed) - also training people to have some empathy towards their coworkers,0
145,"Understanding and acceptance. Like a physical aliment it isn't going to go away once you understand it, it's going to take time to heal. ",0
146,Talk about it more often.,0
147,"I would love to see more open embracement of people with criminal records relating to substance abuse. Substance abuse in America is at about the same level as it has been for decades now, but arrests and incarcerations for it are at an all time high.",0
148,More emphasis on things like meditation and other techniques to increase happiness,0
149,Mental health care should be standard in benefits. Flexibility in schedule and responsibilities should be available when necessary.,0
150,"More support, with less stigma attached to it. Be more open and accepting about it.",0
151,"Just talk about it. Treat it like any other health issue. So many tech companies are so worried about looking “cool” or being seen as a good place to work, but only for specific types of people. The field is not inclusive in any significant way, only enough to look good on a website. I may be a little bitter. ",0
152,"Acknowledge flexible working arrangements (remote working, flexible schedules) as a standard benefit, provide more explicit medical coverage for mental illness, remove stigmas, do not encourage crunch time/overwork as a heroic quality.",0
153,"allow people to breathe, fail, and learn. ",0
154,"accomodation for folk with ADHD, which i know there a ton.  we're not lazy, we want to get things done.  sometimes we just can't",0
155,Treat as normal as occasional cold / sickness,0
156,"Be a bit more active in their support. I think most places would work something out, bit nothing is prepared in advance.",0
157,Avoiding heavy workloads and providing paid time off to spend treating or recovering from mental health issues.,0
158,Assurance from companies that anonymity and full support will be guaranteed ,0
159,Better support/training for people so that everybody isn't expected to perform at 1000% 24/7 in a way that is particularly unsustainable with mental health issues.,0
160,Employers need to share more resources on insurance coverage and becoming more tolerant of missing work on days that employees need to recharge. Taking one long vacation doesn't help.,0
161,"Flexibility, allowing people to work their own way.",0
162,Acknowledge its existence ,0
163,"more informations about things frequently encountered (depression, ptsd, etc.), infos about how to get help, formation for managers and like to better understand that. to be able to ""isolate"" and reduce stress/work on a worker and better confidentiality to talk about that.",0
164,Acknowledge that MH issues are real and have a profound impact on tech workers who use their brains to work. Depression has blunted my memory to the point where I don't remember simple things (I have any number of Stack Overflow bookmarks). The treatments are often as bad as the diseases. My antianxiety medication makes me fuzzy and apathetic. My friend who had ECT suffered *severe* memory loss and was unable to do her job for several weeks even after she was medically discharged.,0
165,"Make mental health a priority, talk about mental health issues, allow time off for individuals who need it. ",0
166,"Relaxation rooms, closed workspaces, accurate techspecs (if any at all), time management, fair pay.",0
167,Offer more resources and education.,0
168,They see the employees daily for weeks and years on end. Providing that information or notation of behavioral anomalies could allow the employee to make a better judgement call on getting treatment. It could also aid doctors in figuring out if their patient needs care right away for their mental health. Put the restrictive surveillance of the employees to better use than using it to bitch at them if they take 3 minutes to go for a piss instead of 2.3 minutes.,0
169,talk about it,0
170,less of a stigma,0
171,Help employees not feel ashamed of it.,0
172,We have a reasonable health system in the Netherlands ,0
173,Put as much effort into raising awareness for this leading cause of death and disability as they do for diversity and wellness initiatives.,0
174,"Even when we have access to services, and even when we know we have that access, our industry and the companies I've worked for, don't make it clear that it's OK to talk about this stuff or ask for help and accommodation.",0
175,"Treat it essentially the same as physical health issues.  Make it clear that mental and physical health of employees is important, and provide information to support both.",0
176,remove stigma,0
177,"Speak about it more openly, educate more",0
178,Talk about it.,0
179,"Recognize that coding for example takes a lot of creativity and a fresh, clear state of mind. Its not a matter of just putting in hours.",0
180,"They should show that normal people (engineers, accountants, secretaries, not executive) have mental health problem, are receiving non-invasive help and are functioning or getting better. But I would not accept to be the one to be shown. Isn't it ironic?",0
181,"For my issue, all that I want is privacy, and I feel that every employer for which I've worked meets that requirement.",0
182,"There's still a massive stigma against those with mental health issues. Especially those that are viewed as being ""more"" disruptive to getting work done. It would be great to see that addresses within the industry itself. ",0
183,Talk about it more and invest in employees well being,0
184,"I think more employers need to learn about mental health. More training, classes or tools on how to recognize symptoms, how to talk to employees and what their state/local health providers offer.",0
185,State explicit support for taking sick days for mental health issues. State explicit support for employees who are dealing with mental health issues and say that they are just as important as physical health issues. Offer health insurance plans that subsidize or cover mental health. Be more aware of addiction/alcoholism recovery and be more sensitive/sensible with work events.,0
186,Mental health first aid training. Talking about it openly.,0
187,Mental health is not separate from physical health.  Removing that stigma would improve access and acceptance.,0
188,More awareness that mental health issues are very common in tech,0
189,More resources and third-party expert help.,0
190,I dont hear much about this either way tbh so really can't comment effectively,0
191,I don’t think it’s an industry specific problem but a problem as a whole across the board.,0
192,Something like company psychologist service.,0
193,"Destigmatize it so that people don't feel like they are othered, and so that no one acts like ""no one here has mental illness/is disabled/etc"".  Find plans that don't place limits on how many times you can see a professional or what you can see a professional for (ex. autism diagnosis is covered but no follow-up therapy related to it is).  Enable spaces where (safe) open discussion can happen - mini support groups, or similar.  Spaces run by people who have the illnesses in question would be lovely.",0
194,Less emphasis on long hours,0
195,"There needs to be more education. Tech work is extremely mentally taxing and in the same sense that athletes are more likely to sustain physical injuries, tech workers are more likely to sustain mental injuries. While we can strive to avoid this, I think it's an unavoidable part of the work.

Talking about this openly goes a long way to helping - but also providing at work support. Could you imagine if when a athlete was injured they had to outsource all support and treatment of that injury?

I understand not all employers have the resources to provide in house support groups, but these employers should be aware of community resources and be encouraging their employees to take advantage of the resources. Lead by example. Mentally healthy supervisors help foster mentally healthy employees.",0
196,discuss mental health support with all new employees,0
197,we need care and support and open environment to discuss. people who cannot be supportive should not work here.,0
198,"I think slowly restoring the ""self-care"" time of employees is a big first step. Having the ability to disconnect from being responsible 24/7 for the health and wellbeing of a computer service is important. And not just on scheduled vacation times, but regularly and generally as a rule. 

The best thing I've gotten is being in a results-based work flow. I'm not required to be at work at a time, but to get work done. This allows me to have my own Self-Care moments or days without worrying about not being ""there"" for work.",0
199,"Better coverage, allow remote work no questions asked. ",0
200,"Discuss issues more openly. Allow for more modified work environments (work from home, etc.)",0
201,"Its a cultural thing like Racism, or Sexism. If one looks at the media people with mental disorders are perceived in a negative way. I think it is just a lack of education. ",0

209,Open conversations. Patience. Options for leave which let people take time and come back instead of quitting.,0
210,"Prevent burnout. Seriously reprimand or give negative reputations to companies that allow burnout and have burnout as part of the culture. Burnout as part of company culture looks like working longer than 8 hours a day; having PagerDuty go off in the middle of the night for someone who isn't on-call; not allowing employees to unplug during vacation. Ways to prevent burnout: Allow employees to unplug when not working (nights, weekend).

Never let it get to the point that an employee commits suicide due to working conditions.",0
211,Normalizing more healthy work habits. Too many employers talk positively about mental health but still promote unhealthy work hours and habits,0
212,The industry is very focused on productivity to the point that anything that takes away from it is hidden.,0
213,"I don't think is an issue from the tech industry in general, but mental health issue is still not fully viewed as a health issue. This can be easily represented as the number of times that your plan covers your appointments with a therapist. I haven't ever seen a plan that would cover you indefinitely, most of them cover 10 sessions in a year. Because the mental health is a lot more common on the tech industry it would be necessary for this industry, especially really big corps which are viewed as role examples, to push for a more significant change on that aspect.",0
214,"Tech companies tend to exude this air of positivity, which can make it feel like you don't belong. If companies were more aware of these problems and actively provided platforms for engagement it would benefit a great many people. ",0
215,"Talk about it openly. Talk about their issues, offer meditation classes, practice sessions, and encourage people to take them, as well as mental health days off (maybe those could be included in the contracts, singled out as separate from regula ""sick-leave"")",0
216,"Become more acceptable of it, such as explicitly allowing sick time for mental issues besides physical",0
217,"I think the fact that this survey exists is a positive sign. I am also encouraged that the open source community is pushing technology culture to be open about these issues. I strongly believe that the best technologists are creative people and creative people are more vulnerable to mental health disorders. For example, bursts of creative energy/passion can alternate with lows.",0
218,Raise awareness - mental health is mostly like physical health. Diabetes and Depression are both caused by the inability of an organ to regulate chemical balances in the body.,0
219,Hire psychologists ,0
220,Encourage people to be open. Encourage people with MH issues to talk about living with them yet still doing a gret job.,0

222,Keep trying to eliminate the stigma of it.,0
223,Less pressure ,0

To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).

Employers need to reach out and be empathetic. Assume the employee is not performing well for a reason. And offer to help. ",1
425,"Keep schedules flexible to roll with the punches the employee might be going through on any given day. Encourage open communication on both sides. Full medical benefits, including therapy. Also, an Employee Assistance Program for employees to call when in crisis to have someone to call and talk to and get a rapid referral for 8 therapy sessions (EAPs do a lot of other awesome things too!) FSAs, so employees can afford medication and treatment at a pre-tax rate.",1
426,"Oh gosh, that's a huge question. Mainly be kind and patient and provide support options.",1
427,"Train line managers to handle it, and have guidelines for things that would help. Also more mental health first aiders and mental health sick days. Also therapy should be included in health benefits",1
428,Provide additional resources and avenues for accessing mental health support outside of the employee hierarchy (eg without going through a superior),1
429,"you have to reverse the stigma, let people know their jobs aren't at risk",1
430,"discuss options in healthcare plans, more discussion about services, offer free counseling services.",1
431,"It varies wildly by company.  I've had really good experiences, but I know at least one friend who works in a different part of the industry who has struggled.  Like anything, it depends on the business and specific managers.",1
432,Allow more flexible working hours. Stop focusing on working too much overtime as a proxy for productivity. Treat mental health issues as physical health issues (and handle both better!).,1
433,Avoid a culture of relentless pressure,1
434,Talk more! But respect privacy too ,1
435,"Encourage conversations in the workplace about supporting ourselves and each other through challenging times. I think everyone experiences reactions to stress, pressure, grief, and troubling life events. If we have an open and friendly policy about staying home from work with a fever/illness, we should also be open and supporting about caring for mental health in similar ways.",1
436,Reassure people that there won't be negative consequences to talking about a mental health issue. Educate employees about how to handle colleagues' mental health issues sensitively,1
437,"The majority of the tech industry only pays lip service to true work/life balance. They talk about how important work/life balance is but they only truly reward the workaholics resulting in the crazy 50-60 hour work weeks and crunch time stories we all hear about and experience. Tech companies are designed as engines to turn youthful ambition into money in the most efficient way possible ... by burning through people and only keeping the absolute strongest, luckiest, or most ruthless.",1
438,Previous employer had a psychologist come in once a week and any member of staff could privately book a session. More initiatives like that would be good,1
439,Better awareness culture-wise. Admins letting employees know about options for treatment/time off,1

442,"Make a pointed example that everyone has mental health issues, and to treat it as less of a stigma.",1
443,Encourage employees to have regular mental checkups just as they would physical ones. Broadcast what mental health benefits the company provides and encourage them to use them. ,1
444,"I think everything we've done, mental awareness wise, has been led by one awesome employee and the company facilitates it but they don't do a lot on their own. We are more open about it than other workplaces but it could be better if the company owned more of it",1
445,I think we should all talk more openly about mental health.  That also requires that we have empathy for those that do talk about it.,1
446,Encouraging more openness. Providing enough paid leave and time for things that aren't work.. having your whole life and identity wrapped up in work is damaging. ,1
447,"Employers should provide mental health benefits, clear guidelines around how they'll support someone suffering with mental health issues, awareness of mental health issues, training for managers / leaders so they are aware of the signs of mental health issues (burnout, for example), and show an acceptance of those dealing with mental health issues.",1
448,They want to be well intent to keep their employes,1
449,"Continue to advocate for proper handling of individuals with mental health issues, allow for more leniency in regards to working from home, removing distinction between PTO (sick, vacation, personal, etc) so as to allow for more mental health days if needed, continue to educate employees on how to utilize their provided health insurance plan effectively to diagnose and treat mental health issues, and provide resources to employees to seek help for themselves and others in situations where none of the above would otherwise be applicable. ",1
450,Just talk to each other,1
451,Industry thinks that the brain is something that a person can control.,1
452,"many companies have a culture of output with little to no compassion for the mental health of their employees, which is ironic because our mental facilities are the only tool we have to create output",1
453,"Educating team members to understand how and why people act when they are affected by a mental health issue. And to let them know their capabilities for caring for themselves and what will be supported. (i.e. working from home, taking leave, flexing time, etc.)",1

460,"Openness, resources, concessions, flexibility when mental health issues affect work.",1
461,"Be aware that mental health issues exist, but that they do not necessarily define a person as a whole.  It is part of who they are, at least for a time.  Unlike ethnicity, race, skin color, etc, it may change in time.",1
462,"Make sure that talking openly about it has no negative effect on the work, applications and the likes. ",1

466,No.,1
467,Pay for treatment.  Offer in-workplace counceling,1
468,awareness. access to resources and education on the subject. in house therapy. ,1
469,"I think clearer boundaries need to be set so that employees recognize that their mental health, like their physical health, is their own responsibility. Employers can assist folks with resources, but employees are accountable for accessing those resources to keep themselves healthy enough to perform their job functions. If these resources aren't enough, then employees need to feel comfortable moving on to more accommodating arrangements for themselves. Employers aren't medical care givers, as an employee I would not want them to be, and employment arrangements must be mutually beneficial.",1
470,Ban the crazy culture of working non-stop 365 days a year! Breaks should be encouraged and a healthy balance of work and rest should be the default expectation in all workplaces. ,1
471,"I feel it offers greater support than other industries as it has a strong focus on work-family-conflict and out of work demands, great number of tech-related health efforts and support",1
472,"Industry: Actively work to replace the stereotype of a developer - you know the one, the stereotype is that a programmer doesn't need sleep, can live off of Soylent or Doritos and Mountain Dew, can execute bug-free code for like days on end without getting up from their desk - with one that is more humane. Programmers are people, jeesh.  Employers:  Don't be assholes.",1
473,More awareness!,1
474,"Awareness of how IT work affects mental health, awareness of resources, destigmatize, community",1
475,"Encourage more open discussion to remove stigma, encourage team members to think of mental health issues as similar to physical health issues.",1
476,Increase services and awareness ,1
477,"I think the first step is acknowledging mental health as a priority in the tech community. In this industry, there's huge emphasis placed on output of information, data, and tangible results - often at the expense of the employees actually producing these results. Recognition and acknowledgment on a real, fundamental level would do a lot to change companies' stances on mental health. ",1
478,Encourage people to look after themselves before an issue,1
479,Be clear that we are humans and that feelings (good and bad) are part of our lives and jobs,1
480,Make sure that mental health options are clearly outlined in employee benefits literature.  Provide employees a safe place to talk if need be like an EAP.  Provide quiet rooms and personal spaces to find time to relax.,1
481,realize when treated a person will provide good work and when it isnt treated the company will spend more money on sick time and ok work,1
482,"Meaningful support, at a minimum, in the form of acknowledging mental health and encouraging a non-stigmatized attitude toward mental health issues.",1
483,Normalize it. Encourage healthy work/life balance. Discourage hero culture.,1
484,"More outreach, more understanding of limitations (too many job adverts that list going above and beyond/being a ""rockstar"" etc. which is inaccessible to people who need time to decompress and need periods of less stress between projects). More openness in general.",1
485,Evaluate team performance instead of individuals.,1
486,"Actively talk about it as just a normal part, similar to (physical) wellness programs",1
487,Stop expecting everyone to work free overtime! I hate that it's an expectation that you code all but 24/7. That's not good for my mental OR physical health.,1
488,I think all companies would benefit from the work OSMI does. I think having an open focus on mental health on the same level as physical health in the organization would be beneficial. ,1
489,"I'm not entirely sure. I think the tech industry might be one of the more accepting industries, but there's still a pretty big stigma attached to mental health issues.",1
490, ,1
491,There should be a greater understanding of how our work is affected by mental health issues. Employers should know that everyone has a health issue of some sort (or will occasionally) and it's not something that should carry a stigma.,1
492,"Talk about it more, encourage working fewer hours, taking longer breaks, better work/life balance",1
493,Offer more mental health care and make sure employees are okay.,1
494,I haven't worked anywhere with good management that could improve on this specific issue.,1

496,more resources. especially as a large amount work from home,1
497,"For starters, be aware of what mental health entails/encompasses. Learn how it is that an employer can help, or support someone with mental health issues. Finally, be understanding/endorsing of ""mental health days"". My brain is my toolbox as a software engineer, sometimes I need a day just to polish the rust off.",1
498,"The industry encourages long hours, an unhealthy work/life balance, and perfection. Having time off and encouraging taking time off for employees would be a step in the right direction - it might lead to temporary losses (1 less person to work on a project), but would be beneficial for all parties involved in the long run.",1
499,"Focus more on work/life balance, people who overwork and the teams that encourage this, try to provide support for the whole person (physical, intellectual, mental, etc)",1
500,"More generous leave policies for employees dealing with mental health issues. Ability for employees to take leave to care for friends in crisis, not just family members. Many employees in the tech industry do not have families but still have close friends who need their support too.",1
501,"Some employers are really good about letting people know about the physical health benefits they get from insurance, but they neglect the mental health benefits. At a previous job (not tech related) there were services available for mental health that I didn't find out about until I had an anxiety attack at work. Had I known about the services that were available, I could have gotten the help I needed before my work performance was effected.",1
502,"Talk about it, destroy the stigma and give people resources to cope.",1
503,"Better resources and training about how to support people with mental health issues, and how to comply with relevant laws. More emphasis on work-life balance and flexible scheduling/locations.",1
504,"It would require Tech to get off of its elitist approach of hiring that openly removes the voices of those who arent ""go getters"". I am tired of the buzz words that this industry uses to validate its discrimination. ""culture fit"" ""not technical enough"" ""they cant move fast enough"" or any other vague hiring motif that allows people to substitute facts with personal bias. ",1
505,"Mostly, respect work/life boundaries more. 40 hours is a lot, reduce time overall or be OK with sprinting: 3# hours some weeks, 4# hours some weeks. Work medical leave into scheduling. Work sick days into scheduling. Encourage people to talk about how they navigate their tendencies in order to ease into discussions about navigating and mitigating disorders.",1
506,More openness would be good,1
507,"Free counseling, available resources",1
508,"Tech is far too focused on end goals at all costs. Burn hard, burn fast, replace candle. The people are rarely seen as such.",1
509,"Raise awareness of how common it is and normalize it as something easy to talk about. Enforce minimum time off policies and promote disconnecting from work to support a healthy work/life balance. Offer paid medical assistance and erp programs. If the office provides food, avoid unhealthy food that can exacerbate mental health  issues. Offer workplace seminars on how to recognize and talk about issues. Offer workspaces with natural light and privacy.",1
510,Acknowledging how stressful the industry is.  Making sure to speak about support for mental issues as openly as physical issues.  Encouraging people to do self-care activities.  Offering programs to help people lower stress.,1
511,have a company therapist or psychiatrist. ,1

513,"Build more awareness, promote mental health days, promote work life balance",1
514,"Eliminate the stigma and be more upfront with wellness programs and benefits that may be helpful, without you needing to seek them out.",1
515,"Overvalues behaviors that lead to burnout, machoness, and anti-social behaviors",1
516,"Medical issues, in some way or the other,  affect us all. Any employer should give due attention to the overall health of it's people. This should be part of the benefits scheme of every employer.",1
517,.,1
518,Conduct awareness related towards health and pump them to have a healthy life style with exercise and all.,1
519,"I think in general there is a don't ask don't tell attitude. Some will provide some benefit as a token, but I'm not sure they care deeply to help those who want help.  Perhaps if employers were required by law to provide this benefit some others would take advantage of it. I think the harder issue is helping people see that it's ok to accept help, and get treatment. No one would say you are weak for getting a broken leg treated, but some think those with mental disorders just need to get over it.",1
520,"Be considerate in regards to an employee's mental health. Be willing to accommodate an employee's requests to enable them to succeed in their position. Forgive the employee if they happen to make a mistake that can be related to their illness, but don't give them a free pass either. The employer should expect the employee to be successful in their position, but accept that the employee may do things differently than they would expect to achieve that success. Lastly, the employee and employer must understand that pills don't teach skills.",1
521,"For the most part, if the tech industry treated underrepresented groups (people of color, lgbtq+, women) better, I  believe that treatment of mental health issues would be better as well.  As a cis white man, I  believe that  my mental health issues would be handled well and without question, but I do not  believe that would be the case for some of my co-workers.",1
522,Provide open support and resources.,1
523,"I think putting people in ""one size fits all"" environment to work in is suboptimal. Sure the 9-5 works for some people but as far as for me personally an employer is getting way less value out of me as an employee if I were to be forced to work that way - and most employers don't like suboptimal investments. 
I think open communication is also a big thing. Making sure the people that work for you know that it is okay if they have a mental illness, it made my anxiety way worse to worry about it. 
If there were actual protocols about mental illness at work. When I started work, I knew exactly what to do if I got sick, how many sick days I had and who I had to notify. ",1
524,"It should be okay, at any company, to say ""I am having a ton of anxiety today, I need to do X or Y to deal with this, will be offline.""",1

526,Flexibility for days where work just isnt going to happen.,1
527,We should be more actively support people with mental health issue.,1
528,"The industry need standards to prevent employees from developing mental heath issues, I believe that most of it can be prevented if it shows more consideration for the human condition. We are not machines, we need a sustainable work pace, we cannot be threatened all the time by unrealistic deadlines, a balance need to be found. ",1
529,"The industry in general seems to have a fetish for the manic portion of the bipolar cycle, while actively looking down upon the depressive portion of the cycle, or those ""normal"" mental health (aka 1x employees).  Not sure what the industry can actually do except stop being so macho about money and growth and productivity.",1
530,"Build more flexible scheduling to accommodate for intense periods of creativity, focus, and stress that dont conform to 9-5 mentality",1
531,Just breaking the stigma. ,1
532,More awareness and less stigma. Normalize people taking sick days/advocate for therapy even if you're not in a crisis situation,1
533,"Minumum paid time off. More control over deadlines, work load, *manager training*.",1
534,"Basic understanding of different personalities doesn't seem to be present in the tech world, let alone mental health. Management need to be people managers, not just experts in their field. Managers need training and support. Workspaces need to support quiet and profligate work as well as collaboration",1
535,Offer the same amount of encouraging healthy behavior campaigns and peograms for mental health as they do physical health.,1
536,The tech industry needs to understand that mental health is as important as physical health and that mental health and physical health affect people all over the industry,1
537,no,1
538,Provide training or resources to educate or normalize health differences,1
539,Be more welcoming and supportive. Accept mental health as a non taboo subject and simply a part of life.,1
