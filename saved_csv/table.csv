,Briefly describe what you think the industry as a whole and/or employers could do to improve mental health support for employees.,Would you feel comfortable discussing a mental health issue with your coworkers?
0,They don't take it seriously,1
1,"raise awareness, talk about it to lessen the stigma",1
2,"Education and awareness, statistics, add supportive writing to the company handbook",0
3,"More support, less burnout and death marches",1
4,I think tech is more internal and they don't really talk about feelings or issues.,0
5,"Awareness, changed work schedules and expectations",0
6,"Be more vocal about supporting employees with issues, and supporting mental health time off.",0
7,I think we over work ourselves and each other. We expect everyone to be connected all the time and humans just weren't meant to work to this degree. We need to cut each other more slack,0
8,Don’t know ,0
9,ok,0
10,Be open about talking about and open about accommodations for it and stop pushing workers toward burnout. ,0
11,"Make employees more aware of any programs they have options to, STOP firing people that have these problems rather then deal with it. Realize that just because someone might miss a lot of work its not because they are lazy. With me its because of stress and depression. My job is almost nothing but pressure/stress and trying to make everything perfect. I'm a QA and the entire companies software dependability rests on my shoulders alone. ",0
13,"I think that the opportunity to have mental health sick leave should be just as important as normal sick leave. Also, burnout is a huge issue in tech.",0
14,People do not talk about it enough. There are not enough mental health initiatives in tech when compared to others (e.g. diversity & inclusion). ,1
15,More awareness both for ability to find treatment and also what employee options are in the workplace,0
16,important,1
17,Raise awareness and offer services,0
18,Awareness & open talks to lower the obstacle of talking about it.,0
19,"Speaking more openly without judgement is a great start I find. And educating people is of utmost importance. 
If one is educated on a subject, they know what to expect. The unknown makes people defensive and apprehensive I think. Not to mention stereotypes being perceived as facts. ",0
22,Be more open to actively discussing mental health and what resources are available internally and externally.,1
23,Be more open about mental health issues and offer support to this in need.,0
24,We have ZERO coverage for any mental health counselling. It all comes from a shared pool of physio / massage yearly allowance. Which is mere 1000 a year. ,0
26,x,0
27,I feel like just providing easier access to and more information in general about mental health resources would go a long way.,0
28,"I think that the industry provides appropriate benefits and that attitudes are accepting of differences. However, the tech industry is notoriously stressful, and likely to exacerbate difficulties.",1
29,"Much increased spending / education on better understanding mental health, generally, how and in what ways these diseases affect the afflicted, coupled with an unwavering commitment to provide the support so long as the employee keeps his / her end of the bargain ",0
31,"Be into it at all. Tech companies jump at the chance to participate in drinking events but mental health events are not considered. Also, conferences and meetups could be less alcohol focused. People who take medication for a disorder or who are in recovery cannot drink; we are woefully forgetful of this fact. Consider offering sparkling cider and other non-alcoholic, non-water beverages at your next meetup.

Very few companies offer employees time during work hours to take care of personal things. Most doctors do not work outside business hours, it is hard to go to therapy and have a full time job.",0
32,More proactive open discussions.,1
35,Knowing about mental health issue appears in everywhere in the industry. Know the reality.,0
36,"Open dialogs about mental health, a cutback on hours, less of a reliance on alcohol for social events.",1
37,Recognizing that people have problems and give them time to deal with them. The same time it would be for going to see a physical doctor or a dentist.,0
40,More focus on personal time and well being.,0
41,Need programs like OSMI.,0
42,"Get some LCSW's in there to talk with folks. A lot of IT folks have the same issues going on, and the same personalities, and concerns. It's why they all end up in a room geeking out together, with the same conflicts. ",0
43,Remove the stigma of it being a condition of hiring or continued employment.,0
44,more proactive support & education,0
45,Generally be open about resources and the commonness of Mental Health issues.,0
46,"Clients (of agencies, etc.) are less forgiving of mental illness than are tech companies or agencies. Outdated project management methodologies (waterfall) and management techniques create a stressful, every-man-for-himself atmosphere in which a mentally ill person inevitably loses out.",0
47,"I think rules should be established and enforced around break times, rest, and vacation, as they would have been for factory work. The tech industry has ground down any advances made with labour laws with regards to well-being.",0
48,"just talk and listen, discuss together, provide health benefit",0
49,Being open and honest from the start.  Expressing that it doesn't mean you are a bad employee.  They should also openly provide resources for help.,0
50,"General wellness programs, talking openly about, which is something I see more and more",1
51,Just acceptation ,0
52,"Mandatory, supported vacation AND sick days. Allow leadership tracks that still support doing technical work/direct contribution. Train managers and employees about signs of depression and burnout. Create cultures of recognition of all roles contributions, not just developers.",0
53,Not sure,0
54,Recognise and address the Global issues of CVS or Screen Fatigue (Asthenopia) by risk assessing the DSE as well as just the furniture !,0
55,They see the employees daily for weeks and years on end. Providing that information or notation of behavioral anomalies could allow the employee to make a better judgement call on getting treatment. It could also aid doctors in figuring out if their patient needs care right away for their mental health. Put the restrictive surveillance of the employees to better use than using it to bitch at them if they take 3 minutes to go for a piss instead of 2.3 minutes.,0
56,"Training, and guidelines, may help deal with the prejudices associated with mental health issues at work.",0
58,Awareness and support. ,1
59,Empathy. Every industry should pause and consider the experiences of people with mental health issues or disorders. Only then will genuinely constructive plans be drawn that can support those people through their careers. ,1
60,Raising awareness. Group wellness activities. Top down communication and people to talk to at all levels. ,0
61,Treat is the same as a physical issue,0
62,Encourage people to be open. Encourage people with MH issues to talk about living with them yet still doing a gret job.,0
63,"Its about perception, they cannot manage their perceptions and fall for them whatever they think so first they have understand mental illness can be treated with support and care and treating the person with the same manner, so that it will not further increase",0
64,Acknowledge when there is a lack of balance in work/life and don't tout it as a badge of honor.,1
68,"Offer better benefits, like an HSA/FSA match in recognition that behavioral health providers are rarely in network, even for the best plan options. Make it an open, concrete part of the culture that discussing mental health is acceptable without forcing any single person to disclose or discuss when they are not ready to do so.",0
69,Improve culture to lower burnout rates,1
70,Encourage more open discussion; emphasize mental health care when discussing benefits.,0
72,"Listen, be compassionate, obey the law, and realize that working with an individual creates loyalty, not a shirking of duty. ",1
73,"Destigmatize it so that people don't feel like they are othered, and so that no one acts like ""no one here has mental illness/is disabled/etc"".  Find plans that don't place limits on how many times you can see a professional or what you can see a professional for (ex. autism diagnosis is covered but no follow-up therapy related to it is).  Enable spaces where (safe) open discussion can happen - mini support groups, or similar.  Spaces run by people who have the illnesses in question would be lovely.",0
74,"The industry as a whole is very stressful -- if people were placed above products, I think it would help",0
75,"Just talk about it. Treat it like any other health issue. So many tech companies are so worried about looking “cool” or being seen as a good place to work, but only for specific types of people. The field is not inclusive in any significant way, only enough to look good on a website. I may be a little bitter. ",0
76,"Openly identify the types of mental health disorders that exist, and say the kinds of programs/policies they have in place to help them.  ",0
77,"Honestly,I don’t know. ",0
78,"Empathy, Empathy, Empathy. We are not coding robots. Know your people, create open and supportive working place.",0
80,Mental health is still a dirty secret that is misunderstood. While HR departments are good at checking boxes; education to employees is still weak.,0
81,"Employ, or contract, coaching with someone that has a background in both professional coaching and mental health.",1
82,"Make it feel safe(r) to discuss it. I always felt and assumed that it's not a good idea to be known to have mental health issues. Please note that I did not see others mistreated and I did not experience problems so I cannot justify this assumption --- it was ""in the air"".",0
83,Be more open about the conversation; make it part of a culture of inclusivity,0
84,Keep talking about it. The conversation is important for keeping it in people's minds.,0
86,Less pressure ,0
88,"Recognizing how prevalent mental illness is in the tech community is of huge importance. Far too many of us suffer in silence because despite this common experience we share, the stigmas are so powerful that we can't openly discuss the situation, demand better treatment from our superiors, or fully disclose our condition when applying for jobs.",0
91,\-,0
92,Talk about mental health benefits explicitly. Let employees know about ADA responsibilities of employers wrt disclosures and reasonable accommodation. Actually make those reasonable accommodations rather than looking for reasons to fire people.,1
94,HR is not tech and they are not kind to people with disabilities that are not mobility or vision related.,0
95,Empathy,0
96,"Its a cultural thing like Racism, or Sexism. If one looks at the media people with mental disorders are perceived in a negative way. I think it is just a lack of education. ",0
98,Education!  Education themselves about mental illness.,1
100,"I think they could talk about specific, common disorders more explicitly.",0
101,"identify people clusters, bullying, etc.",0
102,Be more ok with flexible work hours and conditions. Let the work stand for itself instead of the hours put in at specific times. 9-5 5 days a week isn't possible for everyone,0
103,It is seen as decreasing the person's capacity to operate effectively.,0
107,I think sometimes the tech industry creates isolation by default I am not sure how you can get tech guys to crawl out of their hole,0
108,"The values of the tech industry are very much focused on day-to-day productivity, which can be very difficult for people with mental health issues. My experience has been that employers are unwilling to differentiate between the performance impacts of mental health issues and other causes of low productivity. This leads to punishment and shaming, even when the company espouses support for sufferers. I think companies could focus more on what people have to offer, helping find good fit positions, and understanding that those with mental health issues will often have a more cyclical pattern of productivity than others.",0
110,Give managers training on how to help support people with mental health issues in the workplace. Facilities that are available for quiet time etc. Non-forced collaboration in development work as not everyone can handle the cognitive overhead of talking to someone else all day. Managers share their own struggles with the people they work with to destigmatise it. ,1
113,"Correct ""benevolent discrimination"" where someone ""just wants to help"" or ""didn't want to stress you out"" and effectively keeps potential work opportunities from you.",0
114,"I think that people managers must receive adequate training on coaching and providing a secure work environment for workers with mental health. If there is one major problem in the tech industry, it is that people become people managers due to their _technical skills_ rather than their coaching or interpersonal relationship skills. We have managers who are good engineers but awful communicators, coaches, and counselors. ",0
115,I think there should be an inclusive way for mental health to be addressed in the interview process where it will not negatively affect the candidate. There must be a safe way to ask a potential employer if they are able to support your needs. ,0
116,"Open to ideas, funded to support, too many aspergers jokes",0
117,talk about it,0
119,"Reducing stigma would be great, but that's awfully vague and difficult",0
120,More education to break through the stigma.,1
121,"They could be flexible and understand that placing individuals under duress is not healthy. They could accept that some people do not cope well with stress and need extra support. 
They could also ask what support people need, and engage the services of mental health practitioners to make suggestions for positive improvements to the work place.",1
124,"Free subscriptions to meditation apps (Headspace, Calm), and clear messaging that sick days can be used for mental health reasons, not just physical ones.",0
125,"Our industry wears exhaustion like a badge of honor and encourages people to ignore their most basic needs. There's the pressure to always be connected and it can be really toxic. Fortunately there are a few people who care and make that known, but nothing will change unless people either make it a priority when choosing employers OR those in leadership create a conversation around it. ",1
126,More info for employers,0
127,"at a base level, not contribute to disorders in the form of official work policies or unwritten work culture. i.e. ""optional"" work functions for people with anxiety, hyper-stressful situations for people who have trouble coping in those situations, etc. that is, the job itself should not be detrimental. beyond that, having an open discussion about it, letting employees know it won't be held against them, having resources, making employees aware of resources. being understanding. accepting that even though i struggle, i do want to work hard and make a contribution",0
128,I don't know...,0
130,"The tech industry often has a competitive, startup atmosphere that breeds high stress, high pressure work environments.  More can be done to spotlight these issues and give employees the support they need to address their mental health.  That could mean offering more mental health services, or creating an office culture where it is okay to take a ""mental health day.""  ",1
131,Better education and policies with an open culture of support that I believe most do not currently have or even see as important.,0
132,come up frequent mental health checkups,1
134,no,0
135,education,0
136,"Stop stigmatising mental health and taking it as a joke or something that you ""can overcome with a bit of chocolate""",0
137,Simply understanding would go a long way.,0
139,"More support and less stimulating environment (away from ""open office"").",1
140,we still have a suck it up it's just typing mindset as a profession coupled with a tendency to still look at things like lack of sleep as badges of honor,1
143,"I think the fact that this survey exists is a positive sign. I am also encouraged that the open source community is pushing technology culture to be open about these issues. I strongly believe that the best technologists are creative people and creative people are more vulnerable to mental health disorders. For example, bursts of creative energy/passion can alternate with lows.",0
144,¯\(°_o)/¯ ,1
145,"Stop giving in and being controlled by fear, on both sides. Managers and above should have the responsibility to make it very obvious that mental health is strongly supported in the work place.",1
147,"Talk about it more. Make it clear that insurance covers treatment. Don't let it feel so taboo to take sick or vacation time when you are struggling mentally. A healthy brain is just as, if not more, important to knowledge work as a healthy body.",0
151,Just communicate it. It's a big problem and people need to be open and unashamed about it and know that their employers support them.,1
152,"Speak about it more openly, educate more",0
155,"More resources, more acceptance, more conversation. I think that mental health is something people are afraid to address because of lack of knowledge and understanding about what it means to suffer from a mental illness. ",0
156,"I believe there should be a lot more education on what a mental illness is, how it might affect your day to day work, and how to discuss it in a sensitive way. I think there is a lot of misinformation and stereotypes, especially with the use of the word ""crazy"". I am guilty of that too because it is so ingrained in English. Things like ""You're crazy"" when you do something silly or say something weird for example. There is no bad intent with it, but it is still a potentially destructive word to someone struggling, especially silently. I believe education is the largest thing that could help, but instituting mental health awareness and general assistance programs could also go a long way. ",1
157,"the industry is too stressful of an environment.  need to support through emotion regulation training & prioritization of tasks so folks can stop working 24/7.  also need to respect time away (eg, just bc i have a cell phone connect 24/7 doesn't mean i need to be)",0
158,"Talk about it openly. Talk about their issues, offer meditation classes, practice sessions, and encourage people to take them, as well as mental health days off (maybe those could be included in the contracts, singled out as separate from regula ""sick-leave"")",0
160,"need to understand the impact of stress and anxiety, especially when facing illogical deadlines or constantly worried about layoff",0
161,"
",0
162,Something like company psychologist service.,0
163,"I think open conversations are helpful.  Those can only happen when work environments are supportive, and employees aren't afraid that they'll be singled out for being ""different"".",0
166,"Offering mental health benefits in the first place, offering seminars.  My current employer does a great job. They are open about mental health. Previous employers wouldn't even mention it.",1

171,I would like to see leaders set an example by sharing their stories.,0
172,"Tech companies tend to exude this air of positivity, which can make it feel like you don't belong. If companies were more aware of these problems and actively provided platforms for engagement it would benefit a great many people. ",0
173,Open conversations. Patience. Options for leave which let people take time and come back instead of quitting.,0
176,"If senior management / leadership shares their own struggles with mental health issues more, it might make more people be more open about it and reduce stigma",1
181,"Forceably turn off people's computers after 40 hours of work in a week.  The long-hours slog isn't something to be proud of, it's something companies should be ashamed of.",0
182,"Relaxation rooms, closed workspaces, accurate techspecs (if any at all), time management, fair pay.",0
183,Better payment and less extra hours... it´s just about anxiety and stress,0
184,depends on the particular illness I suppose. ,0
185,I think it is across all industry,0
187,"The employees need to feel that they can communicate openly, being trusted and understood",0
190,"The industry should start to pay more attention to mental health problems - which is generated by the much work, overtime, and stress. One solution would be, imho, disbanding the 9am-5pm working hours and let people work when they like, or actually pay people by results instead of worked hours. Another helping factor could be to allow remote working.",0
195,People at all levels need to realize it is normal and need to share and be understanding when it affects work.,1
197,"I have a cushy job at the moment, but I haven't alway.  Everyone should have insurance and accommodations for at least a therapist appointment every week.",1
198,"I think most workplaces in tech just struggle with diversity in general. And placing more value in different types of people, i.e. race/gender/life experience/mental health/family balance, are all related to how the industry as a whole could improve.",0
200,"More education, less stigma, more flexible work conditions would be nice. Less open floor plans because that is just one long PTSD trigger. x_x",1
202,"Flexibility, allowing people to work their own way.",0
203,More open conversations.,0
204,"In US tech start-ups should offer private healthcare (UK we have National Health Service). 
Take care not to stress people over measurements such as commits/day, story points etc.",0
205,"I do not feel comfortable disclosing mental health issues due to American medical insurance (preexisting issue, could lose coverage?) and lack of legal protections for the mentally ill",0
206,"I don't know much about the industry as a whole. From my filter bubble on social media, I see a lot of people in tech who care about this issue and who share positive and negative experiences. But I have no idea if this is a meaningful sample.",1
207,"More support, with less stigma attached to it. Be more open and accepting about it.",0
208,"It's completely a taboo topic. I've read something on the internet, but never in the workplace. There should be more focus on it.",0
210,Care about people ,0
211,I think the parts of the industry that acknowledge burnout and the dangers of hero culture are doing the industry good on this front but it needs to be more widespread.,0
213,"It a very competitive world, asking more and more each time without offer enought work place formation",1
214,Giving more information about possible problems.,0
215,Make awarrness of the possible issues,1
218,"The stigma seems to be going away (eg in Twitter tech communities I see more well-known folks talking about mental health issues) but this still needs work. The next step imo would be more public awareness of effective treatment options: we start to recognise we (collectively) can have problems, next question is what do we do about them?",1
219,"There are so many issues, form supporting a “hero” culture to not actively combating the factors that can contribute to burnout.",1
220,Recognizing that mental health for knowledge workers is as important as physical health for more physical occupations.,1
221,It needs to be talked about more and people need to understand that it's ok/normal. It shouldn't be where people feel like it is something wrong with them more so that a physical ailment. Obviously it's less simple than that.,1
225,"In the tech industry, clients and co-workers I told were super supportive, but I've heard of terrible experiences of others in the tech industry as well. It makes me think I may just be lucky or good at acquiring awesome clients.",0
229,Acceptance,0
230,Talk about mental health openly and continually. Remove stigma from discussing mental health. Give risk-free channels to request mental health help. ,0
231,Recognize it as no different than physical health support.,0
232,"Team members will look out for eachother, but management could do more",1
233,"I think there could be more discussion around it, and making it okay to take time off for mental health. Otherwise they are pretty limited by the shitty health care system in the US.",0
234,"More advocacy groups, and more power for those groups to inform company awareness and policies ",1
235,"\- decrease overall pressure and workload for employes
- better work environment that is open about issues and encourages discussion such that the workplace environment is not unduly stressed 
- realistic time management and goals",0
237,There should be less competition in promotions... Job evaluation...men should be treated equally as women...same rules for both gender...Employees should have empathy ,1
238,"I think the tech industry as a whole really only cares about burn-out and impostor syndrome. Even then, I think these two issues are paid a lot of lip service, however individuals are expected to take care of themselves, preferably outside the office.

I believe that employers should be striving to create an environment where people feel supported in the office and they have access to needed resources without any stigma. 
",1
239,Openly offer more support and make it more accessible ,0
240,Stop treating developers like they aren't human beings. Stop expecting unrealistic deadlines and hound them to finish. Fear driven development leads to triggering these mental episodes. People with a disorder want and can function Ina. Work environment. But there has to be proper training and awareness for this in the workplace to be mindful. This in turn works out positively even for those without a diagnosis. the tech industry needs to treat people better period.,0

274,we need care and support and open environment to discuss. people who cannot be supportive should not work here.,0

277,"Be more proactive in identifying likely triggers for issues (stress, excessive work load, inability to adjust team composition, etc.) and avoid those.

Be more forward with educational resources and making clear what options are available to anyone having any kind of issue, be it mental condition or life-stress.",0

279,IT/Software companies tend to be a bit better than other sectors of business,0
281,Openly listening to employees issues and referring them to appropriate organisation for support,0
283,Remove the stigma.,0

289,"They need to know that we have an issue like they have theirs, just because is ""trendy"" does not mean that we are special or not capable of being a good worker to have around, we all have struggles, and we know how to handle that so the company and coworkers don't suffer from it ",0
292,Increase awareness with annual talk about mental health.  Improve outreach programs.  More flexibility and less emphasis on delivery and over working.  I feel mostly that tech evangelizes working too many hours.,0
293,Put as much effort into raising awareness for this leading cause of death and disability as they do for diversity and wellness initiatives.,0
295,"Stop treating some issues (ADHD, Autism-spectrum disorders) that may or may not affect performance as badges of honor, while promoting work conditions that lead to other mental health issues (anxiety and depression) that more negatively impact workers.",0
297,Encouraging mental health as a valid reason to take a day off or some time away. Recognizing and rewarding those who take mental health seriously as much as they reward and revere those who throw it away to get stuff done. ,1

303,"Diversify beyond Silicon Valley and its societal values, which inherently seem to allow for mental health to be misjudged.",0
304,Hold trainings to normalize mental health issues.  To help reduce the stigma and reinforce how prevalent they actually are and how with treatment people with mental health issues are the same as everyone else.  ,0
306,Having a clear mental health policy that is well known by all.  Providing privacy for discussion.  Providing anonymity for people dealing with mental health issues.  Talking about the importance of mental health.  Taking steps to ensure mental health is maintained.,0
310,"The tech industry fails to address mental health adequately by failing to recognize that mental health issues affect cognitive abilities, and those cognitive abilities are what make our jobs work.",1
311,I think competition and ego drives a lot of people to prioritize work over mental health.  The tech industry doesn't do much to discourage that practice.   There's also a ton of toxic masculinity that leads to a culture of hostility towards emotional responses or acknowledging mental illness. ,0
312,"Less stigmatism, and more understanding. Better options to seek treatment. Less expensive options for treatment.",1

320,"I feel there's not enough awareness around mental health issues in general, nor their impact on developers. In particular, anxiety and depression can lead to a spiraling situation where one does not feel capable of doing the work.

Provide multiple healthcare plans so that employees with mental health issues can choose the plan that's right for them--for instance, a low to middle income employee with a high deductible healthcare plan might find seeing a therapist to be a financial burden if they have not yet hit their deductible, thereby preventing them from going to therapy at all.",1

In many cases, people in other fields, through TV/sitcoms movies, etc., have been exposed to the higher incidence rates for certain issues in the tech industry, but mainly as a source of humor.
