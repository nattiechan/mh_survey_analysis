    "First, it is interesting to mention that a number of disorders impact comfort level discussing with direct supervisors. However, the impact is relatively small based on the magnitude of the percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the comfort level with coworkers, overall perceived ratings of the industry and employers play a role in the comfort level with discussing MH issues with direct supervisors. One possible explanation is that the leadership style of supervisors may tie into one's perspective of the culture and environment of the workplace. The employee may be less inclined to open up to their supervisors if they feel uncomfortable with the company's attitude towards mental wellness.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important discovery is that employees who seek professional help for a MH disorder are 18% less likely to be comfortable with talking about MH. This is something important to keep in mind, since those who are going through treatments may be at a more emotionally and psychologically fragile state that warrants respect for their space and privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, both the willingness of sharing MH diagnoses with friends and family and the ease of requesting medical leave due to mental illness are significant factors of affecting one's comfort level in discussing MH topics with both co-workers and direct supervisors. Employees are more likely to be comfortable discussing MH issues with direct supervisors if they perceive the process to be very easy (38%), somewhat easy (33%), and neutral (11%). Making medical leave requests easier and more accessible to employees could be seen as a conscious effort of companies putting employee's mental health and wellness as one of their priorities, hence encouraging employees to be more comfortable with discussing those topics at work.\n",
