## Minding Our Madness: an analysis on the status of mental health in the Tech industry

#### Abstract:

This project examined employees' comfort levels in discussing mental health (MH) issues at workplace using survey data from the 2017 and 2018 OSMI Mental Health in Tech survey, available on Kaggle. Employees' comfort levels were predicted using qualitative responses in the dataset. Moreover, ease of accessing medical leaves due to mental illness and a positive attitude and atmosphere in the way MH issues are discussed at the workplace are found to be the most impactful changes.
